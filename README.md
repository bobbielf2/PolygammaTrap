# PolygammaTrap
A corrected Trapezoidal rule for near-singular integrals in 2D based on a generalization of the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula.

This repo contains Matlab code that accompanies the paper:
      Wu, B., 2024. An Extension of the Euler-Maclaurin Summation Formula to Nearly Singular Functions. arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.19192.

Symbolic Toolbox is required to run this code.
